::: incremental
- Biomedical research often produces multidimensional datasets—ranging from genomic sequencing outputs to large-scale clinical registries
- Visualization serves as a compression tool, distilling these high-dimensional datasets into interpretable forms
- It is estimated that by the end of 2025, genomics research will generate 2 to 40 exabytes of data annually$^1$
- One human whole-genome sequence alone consumes ~200 gigabytes (raw data) per individual$^1$

- Patterns that remain opaque in raw tables can emerge once data are visualized
- Visualization doesn’t merely summarize data—it surfaces latent structures
- Example: Kaplan–Meier survival curves reveal divergence in patient outcomes over time

  - Enables investigators to assess therapeutic benefit or harm with immediacy

- Visualization acts as a temporal bridge between raw data and actionable intervention
- In clinical research and translational, visualization underpins decision-making through continuous monitoring
- Example: dashboards provide dynamic visual outputs of physiologic parameters—arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and cardiac rhythm
- Dashboards provide clinicians with up-to-date information, enabling timely interventions
- Consolidate various data sources, offering a comprehensive view of patient health
- Visual representations of data assist in making informed clinical decisions

::: {.column width="100%"}

::: incremental
- Data visualization is not just a tool for summarizing data, strategy used to generate new ideas
- Scientific progress hinges on asking the right questions and these questions often emerge when patterns are visible
- Data visualization acts as a catalyst for this process
- Raw datasets (i.e.: genomic sequences and neuroimaging scans) are large and multidimensional, patterns buried in numbers are easy to miss
- Visualization transforms these data into an accessible form, revealing relationships, trends, or anomalies that could inform new hypotheses

- Automated tool that integrates various genomic data types—such as large genomic variants (structural variants [SVs]), gene expression, copy number alterations, and genome annotations—to identify, annotate, and visualize recurrent SVs and their targeted hotspot regions
- Allows researchs to identify SVs associated with changes in gene expression, particularly in the context of prostate cancer
- These genomic regions of interest could affect gene expression and are associated with cancer progression

Visualization in biomedical research performs two critical functions:

  - *Integration*: Brings together heterogeneous data streams (genomics, biomarkers, clinical measures, lifestyle data)
  - *Translation*: Converts those data into formats that clinicians and patients can interpret and use in real time

- For instance, cancer and diabetes are complex diseases - even within a single patient, biology changes over time

  - Visualization provides the scaffolding that allows us to see this heterogeneity and act upon it
