## Lecture Overview

- Discuss how data visualization turns biomedical and clinical data into interpretable evidence
- Match clinical/scientific questions to visuals that reveal trends in biomedical and clinical data
    - time, uncertainty, and trade-offs (survival, subgroups, diagnostics, harms)

Expose heterogeneity and nuances of subgroups

::: incremental
-  Stratified visuals (forest plots, small-multiple curves, patient-level response panels) show variation across subgroups, sites, and biomarkers
- Alternative: general bar plots that provide an overall summary of column data

Make time and uncertainty legible for credible inference

::: incremental
- Good figures carry the when (timelines, numbers-at-risk) and the how sure (bands/intervals) inside the plot
- Alternative: results that show a single endpoint or p-value

**Outcomes over time (time + uncertainty)**

**Research Logic**: Research question centered on how an outcome evolves rather than a single instance 

::: incremental
-  **Consider**: How an event evolves, how fast intervention X accumulates, how long an intervention’s benefits lasts, or how trajectories change after an exposure or intervention

**Outcomes over time (time + uncertainty)**

**Kaplan–Meier (KM) curves with confidence intervals**

::: incremental
-  *Example question*: Does treatment A improve time-to-event vs control?
-  *Why*: Shows survival/progression over time

- Study to determine how well a monoclonal IgG1 antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) impacts survival and how survival status is impacted by mutation status in cancer predisposition genes (i.e.: BRAF)
- Shows stepwise worsening of survival from all-wild-type, RAS-mutant, BRAF-mutant groups

**Key Takeaways:**

- Turns a single endpoint into interpretable dynamics: onset, durability, and timing of benefits/harms
- Supports decision points (e.g., when to escalate therapy, schedule monitoring, or declare futility)

**Subgroups & heterogeneity (uncertainty around effects)**


::: incremental
-  Consider for whom, where, and under what conditions does your intervention differ and how certain are we about those differences?
- Variations between groups may occur based on patient characteristics (age,  biomarker, comorbidity), setting (site, lot, scanner), or time
- *Goal*: generate visuals that show both the estimated effects and their uncertainty

**Subgroups & heterogeneity (uncertainty around effects)**


::: incremental
**Forest plots (treatment effects by subgroup)**

 - *Question*: Is the effect consistent across age/site/biomarker strata?
 - *Why*: Each row shows an effect size with 95% confidence interval

::: incremental
- Study to determine how well low-dose aspirin prevents fractures in 70+ adults
- Plot shows treatment effect of aspirin on first fracture (hazard ratio) across prespecified subgroups (age bands,  etc)
- Key takeaway: no subgroup shows a materially different effect from the overall null result

**Subgroups & heterogeneity (uncertainty around effects)**


::: incremental
 - Prevents over-reliance on a grand average that may hide harm or benefit for key groups
- Supports precision medicine (targeting) and implementation (which sites/protocols need adjustment)
- Helps separate signal from noise: wide, overlapping confidence intervals suggest caution; stable patterns across strata strengthen claims

**Model Diagnostics & thresholds (trade-offs)**

::: incremental
**Visualizations to determine**:
- Measure of statistical performance to guide modeling of biomedical event or intervention
- How well a test/model distinguishes conditions 
- Where to set a cutoff that balances misses vs false alarms

**Model Diagnostics & thresholds (trade-offs)**

::: incremental
**ROC curves with AUC + marked operating point(s)**:
- *Question*: What sensitivity/specificity trade-off is achievable, and where will we operate?
- *Why*: Makes the trade-off explicit; annotate the chosen threshold.

- Helps identify models that overfit or fail to generalize: Prevents deployment of models that look great on paper but fail at low prevalence or are miscalibrated 
- Aligns clinical, operations, and leadership on where to draw the line and what the resource impact will be

**Study Background**

- Results from a randomized, double-blind clinical trial  201 adolescents (12<18 yrs) with obesity who received:
- GLP-1 receptor agonist [enhances glucose-dependent insulin release] leads to lower blood sugar + lifestyle 
- Or placebo + lifestyle

**Study Findings**

- Most adolescents on placebo + lifestyle had little to no reduction in BMI by week 68
- Many show stable or increased BMI (bars at or above 0%)
- Only a small minority crossed clinically meaningful loss thresholds (≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%)

<br>


::: incremental
- Turn clinical and biomedical data into decision-ready evidence by showing:
  - time (trajectories/KM)
  - uncertainty (bands/intervals)
  - Context (baselines, denominators)
  - Rationale : Allow stakeholders to answer questions beyond "is the outcome significant": what happened, when, how much, and how sure are 
- Figures for model evaluation
- Visuals that explicitly show time, uncertainty, heterogeneity, and prevalence-dependent trade-offs turn analyses into decision-ready evidence
